# Path-Planning-project-ERC
This is a path planning project in which code detects the path to reach a goal point from a start point escaping objects in between the grid. The coding language used in the project is Python, and libraries like `Matlplotlib,` `Numpy,` and `Shapely` are used. Object-oriented programming was an essential skill for the project. 
The project uses the RRT algorithm to trace the path. I have given 3 different .npy files  with objects placed at different positions in the grid. You can use any one of the files and run the code to trace the path.
